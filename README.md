# zalora-test

Submitted by: Joshua Fuentes <joshuarpf@gmail.com>

[ Description ]
This is a simple application that demonstrates a few fetures in a typical web application using nodejs as the development platform, together with other modules integrated to it. This is not meant to be a full blown application, and is in no way ready for production. The demonstration includes the following: 

1. Basic nodejs platform
2. Use of "express", a famous nodejs development framework and web server
3. Use of "formidable" , for form parsing
4. Use of an HTML template engine called Handlebars
5. Funcitonal programming, implementing callback functions
6. Utilization of ES6 

Note:
I have just gotten back to funcational programming after a couple of years of strictly doing object oriented approaches, so I am aware that there is a big room for improvement on this one. I welcome all constructive criticisms, and please do criticize as it will help me be better at this.

[ Assumptions ]
Before everything else, I would like to point out that this is intended for an audience who has prior knowledge to this test. I will assume that the user is capable of using git, nodejs, and docker for this matter. 

[ Installation guide ]
1. Clone the repository 
2. Go to the project folder
3. run "npm install"
4. run the main script with the command "node index.js"
